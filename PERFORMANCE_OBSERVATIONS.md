# Performance Observations and Recommendations

This note captures concrete, high-impact opportunities to improve speed and responsiveness in the Silver Estimation App based on the current codebase.

## Summary
- Prioritize SQLite connection PRAGMAs for faster I/O and queries.
- Reduce UI table churn by batching updates and deferring totals calculation.
- Coalesce encryption flushes to avoid heavy blocking writes on the UI thread.
- Trim redundant work at startup and lazy-import heavy modules.
- Optionally migrate hot tables to model/view if data size grows.

## Quick Wins
All quick wins listed here have been implemented:
- SQLite PRAGMAs applied in `database_manager.py:_connect_temp_db`.
- Removed duplicate `makedirs` in `main.py:setup_database_with_password`.

## Database Hotpaths

## Encryption/Flush Strategy
- Implemented: Debounced background flush; immediate flush on exit remains.

## UI Tables (Responsiveness)
- Keep large-table scalability in mind: If row counts grow significantly, consider migrating to `QTableView + QAbstractTableModel` with virtualized access.


## Startup Time
- Logging: Default to INFO in production; avoid heavy string formatting on hot paths unless DEBUG is enabled.

## Schema & Indexes
- Index coverage is solid; verify with real slow queries.
- Composite indexes only if you frequently filter on multiple columns together.

## Small Cleanups
- `main.py`: remove duplicate `os.makedirs(...)` call in `setup_database_with_password`.
- Keep `MessageBox` usage minimal during tight loops; prefer inline status labels (already implemented) to avoid modal stalls.

## Instrumentation
- Add on-demand profiling:
  - `cProfile` wrapper for save/load/historical queries; write stats to `logs/profile_*.txt`.
  - Time table population (row count + elapsed) in logs to verify UI batching gains.
  - Optional `tracemalloc` snapshots around import/print if you suspect leaks.

## Next Steps (Suggested Order)
1) Consider prepared statements.
2) Move heavy queries off the UI thread where needed.

Aligns with patterns in `DOCS/performance-optimization.md`, but tailored to current code paths and hotspots.
